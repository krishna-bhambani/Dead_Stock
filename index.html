                <h2>What is Dead Stock?</h2>
                <p>Dead stock refers to merchandise that remains unsold and unused for an extended period, tying up
                    valuable resources and warehouse space for retailers and manufacturers.</p>
                <p>Managing dead stock is a significant challenge for businesses, as it represents lost revenue and

                    profitability.</p>
